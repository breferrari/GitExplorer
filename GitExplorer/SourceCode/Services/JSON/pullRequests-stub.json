In other part of the lib, optional binding is being used.

While in `NSURLSessionDataDelegate`'s `URLSession(session: NSURLSession!, dataTask: NSURLSessionDataTask!, didReceiveData data: NSData!)` method, `dataTask` in this callback is actually a `NSURLSessionDownloadTask` object, and the unwrap result to an `NSURLSessionDataTask` object is `nil`, which lead to `nil` response data.\n\nSo I moved `NSURLSessionDataTask` above `NSURLSessionDownloadTask` and data task is correctly recognized. \n\nBut I'm not very sure whether `NSURLSessionDownloadTask` object would be recognized as `NSURLSessionDataTask` under iOS 7 too. So this fix may be a new bug. \n",
